# Project-2
While doing these scripts, i used the GitBAsh app on my desktop coputer. I had trouble finding a directory for tyhe backup.sh file.
backup.sh could not execute. However, I managed to code every other file with realtive ease.

- Code Review: Sammie Ortiz
- The until code was working perfectly and was executed properly.
- The for block was missing, so I was unable to review it.
- The if-else block was missing an else conditional statement, but with just the if statements it was working properly.
- The while block was missing a ";" after the "]", so it was unable to run.
